Currently living in Bodø Norway :mount_fuji: originally from Northern California 🌉

🌊 I'm now in the final year of my PhD at Nord University in Bodø studying aquaculture in a changing climate after a Msc in Marine Biology at the Arctic University of Norway (UiT)  🐟

💬 Ask me about kelp, population genetics, eDNA, differential gene expression, or check out my [thesis repo](https://github.com/gghill/thesis-RNAseq)

When I'm staring at GitHub, I'm probably wishing I was diving 🐡, skiing ⛷️, or mountain biking 🚵‍

📖 I'm currently reading The Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu

✒️ I'm currently writing about the impact of increased thermal tolerance on North Atlantic kelp populations in a changing climate

👾 I'm currently playing Middle Earth: Shadow of War, Waterdeep Dragon Heist (5e), and Magic the Gathering

🎧 I'm currently listening to ...
